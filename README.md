## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because we can reject the null hypothesis due to the small p-values.
This model does predict mgp effectively because it has a high R-squared value.
